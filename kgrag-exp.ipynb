As she stepped out of the creaky wooden door of her modest cottage, her heart skipped a beat with excitement and anticipation. Today was her first day of school, and she couldn't wait to show off her prized possession - a magical backpack.\\n\\nHanded down to her from her grandmother, the backpack was no ordinary satchel. Its soft, emerald-green fabric shimmered with an ethereal glow, and its leather straps held secrets that only Anya knew. Within its capacious interior lay an enchanted world, filled with wonders that would ignite her imagination and change her life forever.\\n\\nAnya's parents, kind-hearted Elise and wise-bearded Edward, bid her farewell with warm embraces. \"Remember, my dear,\" whispered her mother, \"use your magic wisely and for good.\" Her father added, \"Always seek knowledge, and let the backpack be your trusted companion.\"\\n\\nWith a skip in her step, Anya set off towards the town's only schoolhouse. On her way, she passed her best friend, Samuel, a curious and adventurous boy with a mischievous grin. \"Hey, Anya,\" he called out. \"Can I see your backpack?\"\\n\\nAnya hesitated for a moment before unzipping the flap and revealing its contents. Samuel's eyes widened in amazement as he peered inside. There, nestled amidst pencils and notebooks, were a shimmering sword, a book of ancient spells, a tiny compass that always pointed north, and a magical key that could open any lock.\\n\\nTogether, they marveled at the backpack's wonders, promising to keep its secrets safe. As they approached the schoolhouse, Anya noticed a group of older children huddled together, their faces etched with fear. Curiosity getting the better of her, she cautiously approached.\\n\\n\"What's wrong?\" she asked.\\n\\nA tall, lanky boy stepped forward. \"There's a monster in the forest,\" he stammered. \"It's been terrorizing the town, attacking animals and even people.\"\\n\\nAnya's heart sank. The town of Willow Creek was small and peaceful, and the thought of a monster brought a shiver down her spine. She knew she had to do something to protect her family and friends.\\n\\nWithout a moment's hesitation, Anya opened her backpack and retrieved the shimmering sword. With a determined gleam in her eye, she turned to her terrified peers. \"Don't worry,\" she said, her voice steady. \"I'll take care of it.\"\\n\\nWith Samuel close behind her, Anya ventured into the shadowy depths of the forest. The trees seemed to whisper secrets as she passed, and the undergrowth rustled with unseen creatures. As they walked deeper into the forest, the air grew heavy and the ground beneath their feet trembled.\\n\\nSuddenly, they came to a clearing, and there before their eyes was the monster - a massive beast with sharp teeth, glowing red eyes, and claws that could crush a human with ease. The creature roared, a thunderous sound that shook the forest to its core.\\n\\nFear surged through Anya, but she refused to let it consume her. She drew the sword from its sheath and charged towards the monster. The blade shimmered in the sunlight, and as it struck the beast's hide, a blinding light erupted, enveloping everything in its radiance.\\n\\nWhen the light faded, the monster was gone, and in its place was a pile of shattered crystals. Anya had defeated the creature with the magic of her backpack, proving that even the smallest of objects could hold the greatest of powers.\\n\\nAs she and Samuel returned to the town, they were greeted as heroes. The people of Willow Creek rejoiced, and the legend of Anya, the girl with the magic backpack, was passed down through generations. And so, Anya continued her adventures, using the backpack's wonders to make the world a better place, one magical step at a time.\"\"\""

    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "You are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\n",
    "You need to extract the information from consecutive samples of text from a much larger text, most likely a book or short tutorial.\n",
    "Only extract information that seems most relevant to the overall subject theme of the text.\n",
    "- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts. They're akin to Wikipedia nodes.\n",
    "- **Relationships** represent the relations or edges between these **nodes**.\n",
    "- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it accessible for a vast audience.\n",
    "## 2. Labeling Nodes\n",
    "- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n",
    "- **Node Type Naming Convention**: Node types should always be written in PascalCase.\n",
    "- **Suggested Node Types:**: Following are some suggested node types that you can use: {node_types}\n",
    "- - Remember that you are NOT limited to these node types. Always choose the node type to be as specific as possible e.g. choose Artist instead of Person if the subject performs some art.\n",
    "## 3. Labeling Relationships\n",
    "- **Relationship Type Naming Convention**: Relationship types should be written in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.\n",
    "- **Suggested Relationship Types**: Following are some suggested relationship types/labels that you can use: {rel_types}\n",
    "- - Remember that you are NOT limited to these relationship types.\n",
    "## 4. Handling Numerical Data and Dates\n",
    "- Numerical data, like age or other related information, should be incorporated as attributes or properties of the respective nodes.\n",
    "- **No Separate Nodes for Dates/Numbers**: Do not create separate nodes for dates or numerical values. Always attach them as attributes or properties of nodes.\n",
    "- **Property Format**: Properties must be in a key-value format.\n",
    "- **Quotation Marks**: Never use escaped single or double quotes within property values.\n",
    "- **Naming Convention**: Use camelCase for property keys, e.g., `birthDate`.\n",
    "- **Type Property**: Do NOT include a 'type' property in the list of properties.\n",
    "## 5. Coreference Resolution\n",
    "- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\n",
    "- If an entity, such as \"John Doe\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \"Joe\", \"he\"), \n",
    "always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \"John Doe\" as the entity ID.  \n",
    "Remember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial. \n",
    "## 6. Strict Compliance\n",
    "Adhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\"\"\"\n",

    "        \"Ah, visualizing 4-dimensional data! That's a tricky one. You can't directly plot 4 dimensions on a 2D screen.  But fear not, there are some clever ways to tackle this! Here's a breakdown of your options and when to use them:\\n\\n**1.  Dimension Reduction Techniques:**\\n\\n* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** This is a classic for reducing dimensionality. PCA finds the directions of greatest variance in your data and projects it onto a lower-dimensional space. You can then plot the first two or three principal components, capturing most of the information.\\n* **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):**  t-SNE is great for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D. It tries to preserve local neighborhood relationships in the lower-dimensional representation.\\n* **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection):** UMAP is a newer technique that often outperforms t-SNE in terms of preserving global structure and being less sensitive to parameter choices.\\n\\n**2.  Interactive Visualization:**\\n\\n* **Plotly:** Plotly is fantastic for interactive 3D plots. You can use it to create scatter plots, surface plots, and more. You can then add controls to manipulate the 4th dimension. For example, you could have a slider that changes the color of points based on the 4th dimension.\\n* **Bokeh:**  Another great interactive visualization library. Bokeh is well-suited for creating dashboards and interactive plots. You can use it to create 3D plots and add interactive elements to control the 4th dimension.\\n\\n**3.  Specialized Libraries:**\\n\\n* **Mayavi:** This library is specifically designed for scientific visualization. It can handle complex 3D data and has features for visualizing 4D data through techniques like isosurfaces and volume rendering.\\n* **ParaView:** A powerful open-source visualization application that can handle large datasets and offers a variety of techniques for visualizing 4D data.\\n\\n**Choosing the Right Approach:**\\n\\n* **Start with dimension reduction:** PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP are good starting points to get a sense of the data structure.\\n* **Consider interactivity:** If you want to explore the 4th dimension interactively, Plotly or Bokeh are great choices.\\n* **For complex 3D data:** Mayavi or ParaView might be necessary.\\n\\n**Example (Plotly):**\\n\\n```python\\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\n# Generate some sample data\\nx = np.random.rand(100)\\ny = np.random.rand(100)\\nz = np.random.rand(100)\\nw = np.random.rand(100)  # 4th dimension\\n\\n# Create a scatter plot with color representing the 4th dimension\\nfig = go.Figure(data=[go.Scatter3d(\\n    x=x,\\n    y=y,\\n    z=z,\\n    mode='markers',\\n    marker=dict(\\n        size=10,\\n        color=w,  # Color based on the 4th dimension\\n        colorscale='Viridis',\\n        opacity=0.8\\n    )\\n)])\\n\\n# Add a slider to control the 4th dimension\\nfig.update_layout(\\n    scene = dict(\\n        xaxis_title='X',\\n        yaxis_title='Y',\\n        zaxis_title='Z'\\n    ),\\n    sliders=[\\n        dict(\\n            active=10,\\n            currentvalue={\\\"prefix\\\": \\\"W: \\\"},\\n            pad={\\\"t\\\": 50},\\n            steps=[\\n                dict(method=\\\"update\\\", label=\\\"W = {}\\\".format(i), args=[{\\\"marker.color\\\": [w[j] for j in range(len(w))]}] , value=i)\\n                for i in np.linspace(0, 1, 11)\\n            ]\\n        )\\n    ]\\n)\\n\\nfig.show()\\n```\\n\\nRemember, the best approach depends on your specific data and the insights you want to gain. Experiment with different techniques and libraries to find the best way to visualize your 4-dimensional data! \\n\",\n",
